== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Zamango service? =
Zamango is a free service on aggregation of casual game content given by leading publishers like [BigFish, Reflexive, Alawar, Nevosoft and others](http://www.zamango.com/articles/affiliate-programs "Actual affiliate programs available at Zamango"). On the other hand, it is also a free plugin for WordPress. [Zamango Money Extractor](http://www.zamango.com/zamango-money-extractor-plugin-wp.html "Zamango M.E. - Earn money with our content") is made for easy embedding of this content on almost any website based on WordPress 2.5+ engine.

= What should I do to have an on-line store for games selling? =
Read [the short instruction for Zamango Money Extractor](http://www.zamango.com/zamango-money-extractor-plugin-wp.html "Zamango Money Extractor - Earn money with our content"). You won't have to pay for anything  except hosting (server), but the majority of serious hosters give free 1-2 week test period, so it is possible not to pay at once.

= Can I modify the post created by Zamango M.E. plugin by myself or by means of outside plugins (synonymizers, etc.)? =
Yes, you can  do it. The only thing necessary to remember is that if someone changes a post except Zamango M.E. plugin, for example, in case of mistakes correction in the description of a game, it will not be automatically corrected on your website.

= Why is it impossible to take the same content directly from all listed publishers? Anyway we must be registered in all these programs. =
Certainly, you can do it yourself, but when you use Zamango you get a number of advantages:

*  the most beneficial partner programme is selected for each game among the game sellers

*  all publishers give promotion products in their own format and their revaluation to the standard demands many efforts, which the service incurs,

*  the plugin to simple and popular WordPress engine helps to create properly looking on-line store with rich set of the goods (games) in some hours even if you don't have HTML, PHP, Perl, JavaScript knowledge - in WordPress everything is constructed from modules and adjusted by mouse,

*  soon we are going to share the additional promotion products, which the publishers don't have.

= What will happen if there are no publisher selling any game, for example? =
In this case after an automatic update (which occurs with an interval specified by you on Zamango M.E. plugin page in WordPress dashboard) the post with this game will be removed without your participation. In case if you've changed post contents, the post would not be deleted, but automatically would become invisible for visitors, and it can be found in WordPress dashboard with a label "Draft" (or "Draft copy").

= Why are pictures (screenshots, icons etc.) for games stored on your server? =
The size of complete promo-graphics set now equals 500 Gb, an it will be increasing in future. A part of Zamang users has no server and rents a hosting, the storage of such big-sized data is not always practicable. Besides, the more disk space the data requires and the more data a site distributes the more expensive the service of a hoster is.
On the other hand, if Zamango user has a possibility to distribute pictures from the server, we only will be glad about it. There are two alternatives:

*   to set up the plugin, which downloads pictures in process of their inquiry, to WordPress, for example, [Super Image Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/super-image-plugin/ "How to download all images automatically");

*   if you have experience in working with any programming language, you may not load all this work on WordPress and do it by outside script - all links to pictures are in XML feed of your channel.

= Why only 20 games are imported from XML after I pressed the button? =

Some web hosts limit time-to-execute for 20-30 seconds, so only 20-50 posts may be imported for this time. That is why we decided to import 20 post per first iteration. Number of games you selected is also affect script speed. After first iteration you may estimate performance and time-to-execute limits and change how many posts must be imported per one iteration. Just try few settings and you'll find the most suitable one.

= Why do I need to register at so much websites? =

We only aggregate the content released by different publishers who offer very nice affiliate programs. We don't represent all these publishers but only help people to compose content provided in different standards in one way.

= Why are games downloaded from zamango.com instead of Reflexive or Alawar? =
Actually all games are downloaded directly from a server of the publisher. The reason why links in your blog guide to zamango.com is simple - the same game can be issued by different publishers with an interval in some days and even weeks and months. And the sales profit from one sale may be different among all publishers. So as soon as more well-heeled publisher begins to sell a game, zamango.com starts to sell this game through his site without tasking yours. By the way, this is the reason why we ask you to register on all affiliates specified in your control panel.

= I have changed the BigFish afcode (or another partner ID). Should I re-syndicate all Zamango posts by Zamango M.E. plugin? =
No, it is not necessary, since your partner ID (afcode, pid, CID etc.) is substituted by the scripts on Zamango server. But you should remember that if buyer has already downloaded a game with old affiliate code and overpass by the purchase link from this game, the commission will go with that old  code.

= I have my own website where I want to create additional section with Zamango content. I have exposed  a parental directory in plugin which all posts should get to, but they have filled the whole main page. =
You may edit the theme's files or use one of the plugins, for example, [Simply Exclude](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simply-exclude/) or [Advanced Category Excluder](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-category-excluder/), to let posts from only one of the categories be published on the main page. With the help of these or other special plugins you may adjust RSS channels for yourself.
Anyway, it will be very helpful to crawl the plugin sector of official WordPress website — there are much of useful plugins.
